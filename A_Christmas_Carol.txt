46 "<STAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOST>"
46 ""
46 "MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt"
46 "whatever about that. The register of his burial was"
46 "signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,"
46 "and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and"
46 "Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he"
46 "chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a"
46 "door-nail."
46 ""
46 "Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my"
46 "own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about"
46 "a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to"
46 "regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery"
46 "in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors"
46 "is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands"
46 "shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You"
46 "will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that"
46 "Marley was as dead as a door-nail."
46 ""
46 "Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did."
46 "How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were"
46 "partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge"
46 "was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole"
46 "assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and"
46 "sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully"
46 "cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent"
46 "man of business on the very day of the funeral,"
46 "and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain."
46 ""
46 "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to"
46 "the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley"
46 "was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or"
46 "nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going"
46 "to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that"
46 "Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there"
46 "would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a"
46 "stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,"
46 "than there would be in any other middle-aged"
46 "gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy"
46 "spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--"
46 "literally to astonish his son's weak mind."
46 ""
46 "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name."
46 "There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse"
46 "door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as"
46 "Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the"
46 "business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,"
46 "but he answered to both names. It was all the"
46 "same to him."
46 ""
46 "Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,"
46 "Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,"
46 "clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,"
46 "from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;"
46 "secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The"
46 "cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed"
46 "nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his"
46 "eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his"
46 "grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his"
46 "eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low"
46 "temperature always about with him; he iced his office in"
46 "the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas."
46 ""
46 "External heat and cold had little influence on"
46 "Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather"
46 "chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,"
46 "no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no"
46 "pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't"
46 "know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and"
46 "snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage"
46 "over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\""
46 "handsomely, and Scrooge never did."
46 ""
46 "Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with"
46 "gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?"
46 "When will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored"
46 "him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him"
46 "what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all"
46 "his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of"
46 "Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to"
46 "know him; and when they saw him coming on, would"
46 "tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and"
46 "then would wag their tails as though they said, \"No"
46 "eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\""
46 ""
46 "But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing"
46 "he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths"
46 "of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,"
46 "was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,"
46 "on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his"
46 "counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy"
46 "withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,"
46 "go wheezing up and down, beating their hands"
46 "upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the"
46 "pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had"
46 "only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--"
46 "it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring"
46 "in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like"
46 "ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog"
46 "came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was"
46 "so dense without, that although the court was of the"
46 "narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms."
46 "To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring"
46 "everything, one might have thought that Nature"
46 "lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale."
46 ""
46 "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open"
46 "that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a"
46 "dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying"
46 "letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's"
46 "fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one"
46 "coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept"
46 "the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the"
46 "clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted"
46 "that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore"
46 "the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to"
46 "warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being"
46 "a man of a strong imagination, he failed."
46 ""
46 "\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried"
46 "a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's"
46 "nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was"
46 "the first intimation he had of his approach."
46 ""
46 "\"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\""
46 ""
46 "He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the"
46 "fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was"
46 "all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his"
46 "eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again."
46 ""
46 "\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's"
46 "nephew. \"You don't mean that, I am sure?\""
46 ""
46 "\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What"
46 "right have you to be merry? What reason have you"
46 "to be merry? You're poor enough.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What"
46 "right have you to be dismal? What reason have you"
46 "to be morose? You're rich enough.\""
46 ""
46 "Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur"
46 "of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up"
46 "with \"Humbug.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew."
46 ""
46 "\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I"
46 "live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!"
46 "Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas"
46 "time to you but a time for paying bills without"
46 "money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but"
46 "not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books"
46 "and having every item in 'em through a round dozen"
46 "of months presented dead against you? If I could"
46 "work my will,\" said Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot"
46 "who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,"
46 "should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried"
46 "with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!\""
46 ""
46 "\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew."
46 ""
46 "\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas"
46 "in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you"
46 "don't keep it.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much"
46 "good may it do you! Much good it has ever done"
46 "you!\""
46 ""
46 "\"There are many things from which I might have"
46 "derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare"
46 "say,\" returned the nephew. \"Christmas among the"
46 "rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas"
46 "time, when it has come round--apart from the"
46 "veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything"
46 "belonging to it can be apart from that--as a"
46 "good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant"
46 "time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar"
46 "of the year, when men and women seem by one consent"
46 "to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think"
46 "of people below them as if they really were"
46 "fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race"
46 "of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,"
46 "uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or"
46 "silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me"
46 "good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!\""
46 ""
46 "The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded."
46 "Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,"
46 "he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark"
46 "for ever."
46 ""
46 "\"Let me hear another sound from you,\" said"
46 "Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing"
46 "your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,"
46 "sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you"
46 "don't go into Parliament.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\""
46 ""
46 "Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he"
46 "did. He went the whole length of the expression,"
46 "and said that he would see him in that extremity first."
46 ""
46 "\"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\""
46 ""
46 "\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"Because I fell in love.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if"
46 "that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous"
46 "than a merry Christmas. \"Good afternoon!\""
46 ""
46 "\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before"
46 "that happened. Why give it as a reason for not"
46 "coming now?\""
46 ""
46 "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;"
46 "why cannot we be friends?\""
46 ""
46 "\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so"
46 "resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I"
46 "have been a party. But I have made the trial in"
46 "homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas"
46 "humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\""
46 ""
46 "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"And A Happy New Year!\""
46 ""
46 "\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "His nephew left the room without an angry word,"
46 "notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to"
46 "bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,"
46 "cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned"
46 "them cordially."
46 ""
46 "\"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who"
46 "overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a"
46 "week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry"
46 "Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\""
46 ""
46 "This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had"
46 "let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,"
46 "pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,"
46 "in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in"
46 "their hands, and bowed to him."
46 ""
46 "\"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the"
46 "gentlemen, referring to his list. \"Have I the pleasure"
46 "of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\""
46 ""
46 "\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\""
46 "Scrooge replied. \"He died seven years ago, this very"
46 "night.\""
46 ""
46 "\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented"
46 "by his surviving partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting"
46 "his credentials."
46 ""
46 "It certainly was; for they had been two kindred"
46 "spirits. At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge"
46 "frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials"
46 "back."
46 ""
46 "\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\""
46 "said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than"
46 "usually desirable that we should make some slight"
46 "provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer"
46 "greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in"
46 "want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands"
46 "are in want of common comforts, sir.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down"
46 "the pen again."
46 ""
46 "\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge."
46 "\"Are they still in operation?\""
46 ""
46 "\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish"
46 "I could say they were not.\""
46 ""
46 "\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,"
46 "then?\" said Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"Both very busy, sir.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,"
46 "that something had occurred to stop them in their"
46 "useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I'm very glad to"
46 "hear it.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish"
46 "Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,\""
46 "returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are endeavouring"
46 "to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,"
46 "and means of warmth. We choose this time, because"
46 "it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,"
46 "and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down"
46 "for?\""
46 ""
46 "\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied."
46 ""
46 "\"You wish to be anonymous?\""
46 ""
46 "\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you"
46 "ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer."
46 "I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't"
46 "afford to make idle people merry. I help to support"
46 "the establishments I have mentioned--they cost"
46 "enough; and those who are badly off must go there.\""
46 ""
46 "\"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\""
46 ""
46 "\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had"
46 "better do it, and decrease the surplus population."
46 "Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\""
46 ""
46 "\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman."
46 ""
46 "\"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's"
46 "enough for a man to understand his own business, and"
46 "not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies"
46 "me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\""
46 ""
46 "Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue"
46 "their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed"
46 "his labours with an improved opinion of himself,"
46 "and in a more facetious temper than was usual"
46 "with him."
46 ""
46 "Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that"
46 "people ran about with flaring links, proffering their"
46 "services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct"
46 "them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,"
46 "whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down"
46 "at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became"
46 "invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the"
46 "clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if"
46 "its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there."
46 "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the"
46 "corner of the court, some labourers were repairing"
46 "the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,"
46 "round which a party of ragged men and boys were"
46 "gathered: warming their hands and winking their"
46 "eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug"
46 "being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,"
46 "and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness"
46 "of the shops where holly sprigs and berries"
46 "crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale"
46 "faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'"
46 "trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,"
46 "with which it was next to impossible to believe that"
46 "such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything"
46 "to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the"
46 "mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks"
46 "and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's"
46 "household should; and even the little tailor, whom he"
46 "had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for"
46 "being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up"
46 "to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean"
46 "wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef."
46 ""
46 "Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting"
46 "cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped"
46 "the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather"
46 "as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then"
46 "indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The"
46 "owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled"
46 "by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,"
46 "stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with"
46 "a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of"
46 ""
46 "        \"God bless you, merry gentleman!"
46 "         May nothing you dismay!\""
46 ""
46 "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,"
46 "that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to"
46 "the fog and even more congenial frost."
46 ""
46 "At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house"
46 "arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his"
46 "stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant"
46 "clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,"
46 "and put on his hat."
46 ""
46 "\"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said"
46 "Scrooge."
46 ""
46 "\"If quite convenient, sir.\""
46 ""
46 "\"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not"
46 "fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd"
46 "think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\""
46 ""
46 "The clerk smiled faintly."
46 ""
46 "\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think me ill-used,"
46 "when I pay a day's wages for no work.\""
46 ""
46 "The clerk observed that it was only once a year."
46 ""
46 "\"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every"
46 "twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning"
46 "his great-coat to the chin. \"But I suppose you must"
46 "have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next"
46 "morning.\""
46 ""
46 "The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge"
46 "walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a"
46 "twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his"
46 "white comforter dangling below his waist (for he"
46 "boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,"
46 "at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in"
46 "honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home"
46 "to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play"
46 "at blindman's-buff."
46 ""
46 "Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual"
46 "melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and"
46 "beguiled the rest of the evening with his"
46 "banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in"
46 "chambers which had once belonged to his deceased"
46 "partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a"
46 "lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so"
46 "little business to be, that one could scarcely help"
46 "fancying it must have run there when it was a young"
46 "house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,"
46 "and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough"
46 "now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but"
46 "Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices."
46 "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew"
46 "its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands."
46 "The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway"
46 "of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of"
46 "the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the"
46 "threshold."
46 ""
46 "Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all"
46 "particular about the knocker on the door, except that it"
46 "was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had"
46 "seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence"
46 "in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what"
46 "is called fancy about him as any man in the city of"
46 "London, even including--which is a bold word--the"
46 "corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be"
46 "borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one"
46 "thought on Marley, since his last mention of his"
46 "seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then"
46 "let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened"
46 "that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,"
46 "saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate"
46 "process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face."
46 ""
46 "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow"
46 "as the other objects in the yard were, but had a"
46 "dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark"
46 "cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked"
46 "at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly"
46 "spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The"
46 "hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;"
46 "and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly"
46 "motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it"
46 "horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the"
46 "face and beyond its control, rather than a part of"
46 "its own expression."
46 ""
46 "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it"
46 "was a knocker again."
46 ""
46 "To say that he was not startled, or that his blood"
46 "was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it"
46 "had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue."
46 "But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,"
46 "turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle."
46 ""
46 "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before"
46 "he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind"
46 "it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the"
46 "sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall."
46 "But there was nothing on the back of the door, except"
46 "the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he"
46 "said \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed it with a bang."
46 ""
46 "The sound resounded through the house like thunder."
46 "Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's"
46 "cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal"
46 "of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to"
46 "be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and"
46 "walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:"
46 "trimming his candle as he went."
46 ""
46 "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six"
46 "up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad"
46 "young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you"
46 "might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken"
46 "it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall"

46 "\"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old"

46 "plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to"
46 "see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,"
46 "before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,"
46 "Joe.\""
46 ""
46 "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;"

46 "produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,"
46 "a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no"
46 "great value, were all. They were severally examined and"
46 "appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed"
46 "to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a"
46 "total when he found there was nothing more to come."

46 "another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it."
46 "Who's next?\""
46 ""
46 "Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing"
46 "apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of"
46 "sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall"
46 "in the same manner."
46 ""
46 "\"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,"

46 "it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock"
46 "off half-a-crown.\""

46 "\"And now undo my bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman."
46 ""
46 "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience"
46 "of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,"
46 "dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff."
46 ""
46 "\"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains!\""
46 ""
46 "\"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward"
46 "on her crossed arms. \"Bed-curtains!\""

46 "\"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and"
46 "you'll certainly do it.\""
46 ""
46 "\"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything"
46 "in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He"
46 "was, I promise you, Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't"
46 "drop that oil upon the blankets, now.\""
46 ""
46 "\"His blankets?\" asked Joe."
46 ""
46 "\"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He"
46 "isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say.\""
46 ""
46 "\"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said"
46 "old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up."
46 ""
46 "\"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I"
46 "an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for"
46 "such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that"
46 "shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor"
46 "a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too."
46 "They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\""
46 ""
46 "\"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe."
46 ""
46 "\"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied"
46 "the woman with a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to"

46 "Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat"
46 "grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by"
46 "the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and"
46 "disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they"
46 "had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself."
46 ""
46 "\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,"
46 "producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their"
46 "several gains upon the ground. \"This is the end of it, you"

46 "he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,"
46 "beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,"
46 "which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful"
46 "language."
46 ""
46 "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with"
46 "any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience"
46 "to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it"
46 "was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon"
46 "the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,"
46 "uncared for, was the body of this man."
46 ""
46 "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand"
46 "was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted"
46 "that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon"
46 "Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought"
46 "of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;"
46 "but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss"
46 "the spectre at his side."
46 ""
46 "Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar"

46 "revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair"
46 "to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is"
46 "not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;"
46 "it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the"
46 "hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,"
46 "and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!"
46 "And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow"
46 "the world with life immortal!"
46 ""
46 "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and"
46 "yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He"
46 "thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be"
46 "his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?"
46 "They have brought him to a rich end, truly!"
46 ""
46 "He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a"
46 "woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this"
46 "or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be"
46 "kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was"
46 "a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What"
46 "they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so"
46 "restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think."
46 ""
46 "\"Spirit!\" he said, \"this is a fearful place. In leaving it,"
46 "I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!\""

46 "Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the"
46 "head."

46 "moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room"
46 "by daylight, where a mother and her children were."
46 ""
46 "She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;"
46 "for she walked up and down the room; started at every"
46 "sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;"
46 "tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly"
46 "bear the voices of the children in their play."
46 ""
46 "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried"
46 "to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was"
46 "careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was"

46 "of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress."
46 ""
46 "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for"

46 "She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke"
46 "truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she"
46 "said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next"
46 "moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of"
46 "her heart."
46 ""
46 "\"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last"
46 "night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a"

46 ""
46 "Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter."

46 "entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had"
46 "visited before; and found the mother and the children seated"
46 "round the fire."
46 ""
46 "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as"

46 "\"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of"

46 ""
46 "\"They're better now again,\" said Cratchit's wife. \"It"

46 "\"Past it rather,\" Peter answered, shutting up his book."
46 "\"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,"
46 "these few last evenings, mother.\""
46 ""
46 "They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a"
46 "steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:"
46 ""
46 "\"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk"
46 "with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.\""

46 "\"And so have I,\" cried Peter. \"Often.\""
46 ""
46 "\"And so have I,\" exclaimed another. So had all."
46 ""
46 "\"But he was very light to carry,\" she resumed, intent upon"
46 "her work, \"and his father loved him so, that it was no"
46 "trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!\""
46 ""
46 "She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter"
46 "--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea"
46 "was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should"
46 "help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got"
46 "upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against"
46 "his face, as if they said, \"Don't mind it, father. Don't be"
46 "grieved!\""
46 ""
46 "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to"

46 "\"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his"

46 "apart perhaps than they were."
46 ""
46 "He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,"
46 "which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas."
46 "There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were"
46 "signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat"
46 "down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed"
46 "himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what"

46 ""
46 "They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother"

46 "that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know,\" said"
46 "Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. \"On"
46 "which,\" said Bob, \"for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman"

46 "wasn't,\" cried Bob, \"for the sake of anything he might be"

46 "\"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of"

46 "one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to"

46 "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to"

46 "He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out"

46 "every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly"
46 "pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows"

46 "globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill"

46 "would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they"
46 "should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in"
46 "less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was"
